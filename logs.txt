Text: convert sentence to words
Generated Code:
Here is the code to convert a sentence to words in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char sentence[100];
    char *word;

    printf("Enter a sentence: ");
    fgets(sentence, sizeof(sentence), stdin);

    // Remove newline character from the end of the sentence
    sentence[strcspn(sentence, "\n")] = '\0';

    // Tokenize the sentence into words
    word = strtok(sentence, " ");
    while (word != NULL) {
        printf("'%s',", word);
        word = strtok(NULL, " ");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code uses the `strtok()` function from the `string.h` library to tokenize the sentence into individual words. It uses a space as the delimiter to split the sentence into words.

Note that this code assumes the maximum sentence length is 100 characters. You can adjust this value as needed.

Generated Code:
Here is a simple C code that converts a sentence into separate words:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_WORDS 100

int main() {
    char sentence[1000];
    char *words[MAX_WORDS];
    int wordCount = 0;
    
    printf("Enter a sentence: ");
    fgets(sentence, sizeof(sentence), stdin);
    
    // Tokenize the sentence into words
    char *token = strtok(sentence, " ");
    
    while (token != NULL && wordCount < MAX_WORDS) {
        // Remove newline character from each word
        char *newline = strchr(token, '\n');
        if (newline != NULL)
            *newline = '\0';
        
        // Store the word in the words array
        words[wordCount] = strdup(token);
        wordCount++;
        
        // Get the next word
        token = strtok(NULL, " ");
    }
    
    // Print the words
    printf("Words: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < wordCount; i++) {
        printf("'%s'", words[i]);
        if (i != wordCount - 1)
            printf(", ");
    }
    printf("\n");
    
    // Free the memory allocated for each word
    for (int i = 0; i < wordCount; i++) {
        free(words[i]);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses the `strtok` function from the `string.h` library to tokenize the sentence into individual words based on spaces. It stores each word in the `words` array and then prints them out. The code also takes care of removing the newline character (`\n`) from each word.
